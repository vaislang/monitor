# New Session Handoff

Start here:

```bash
cd /Users/sswoo/study/projects/vais-apps/monitor
git status --short --branch
scripts/check-reference-gates.sh
```

After committing changes, run:

```bash
scripts/check-clean-checkout.sh
```

After pushing changes, verify the hosted workflow:

```bash
gh run list --repo vaislang/monitor --limit 5
```

The main server slice is intentionally domain-only. It validates current Vais
language surface through IR and native smoke gates. The separate
`server/src/http_adapter.vais` fixture certifies only HTTP listener open/close
runtime wiring.

`playground/monitor.vais` is a synchronized copy of `server/src/main.vais`. If
the server source changes, run `scripts/sync-playground-example.sh` before the
reference gates.

The current source of truth for language and public claims is the sibling
compiler repository:

- `/Users/sswoo/study/projects/vais/compiler/docs/ai/LLM_LANGUAGE_CARD.md`
- `/Users/sswoo/study/projects/vais/compiler/docs/LANGUAGE_SPEC.md`
- `/Users/sswoo/study/projects/vais/compiler/PUBLIC_STATUS.md`
- `docs/GOAL.md`
- `docs/RUNTIME_BOUNDARY.md`
- `docs/ADAPTER_READINESS.md`
- `docs/CI.md`

If compiler behavior and docs disagree, stop and fix the compiler or docs before
adding fallback syntax here.

Before adding HTTP or DB runtime code, run:

```bash
scripts/check-adapter-readiness.sh --require-promoted
```

At the current baseline this is expected to pass. Passing this precondition only
opens adapter work; it does not replace the need for a monitor-specific runtime
fixture and a narrowed runtime-boundary gate.

The current HTTP fixture allows only `__tcp_listen` and `__tcp_close`. The next
adapter task is request parsing/routing; DB persistence and web data wiring are
still later slices.
